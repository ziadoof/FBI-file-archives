                <i>(Editor's Note:&nbsp; Lorenzo Kimball passed away in June, 1999.&nbsp; His web
                    site, from where the following text was obtained, has since been taken

            <p>In early July, 1947 there occurred near Roswell, New Mexico what one
                researcher has described as a "cataclysmic event." A "flying saucer"
                reportedly crashed on the Foster Ranch near Corona, New Mexico. Debris
                from the crash site was found by William "Mac" Brazel, the ranch
                foreman. Brazel took samples of the debris to the Chavez County Sheriffs
                Office where the Country Sheriff, George Wilcox suggested that Brazel
                contact the Base Intelligence Officer, Major Jesse Marcel, at Roswell
                Army Air Field. Under the direction of Colonel William H. Blanchard,
                Commanding Officer of the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell Army Air Field,
                Major Marcel and CIC Agent Sheridan Cavitt accompanied Mac Brazel to the
                Foster ranch to recover some of the debris, which they did. The debris
                was taken to the office of Colonel Blanchard and under orders from
                higher authority some of the materiel was flown to 8th Air Force
                Headquarters, Carswell Army Air Field, Ft. Worth, Texas where it was
                announced that the debris was not from a "flying disc" but that it was
                the remnants of a weather balloon.<em> (See comments below about Colonel
                    Blanchard)</em></p>
            <p>Several books have been published by UFO researchers about the "Roswell
                Incident" claiming that what happened was in reality a crash of an
                extraterrestrial spacecraft, that alien remains were recovered and that
                the U.S. military covered up the whole affair. There have been a spate
                of TV shows and movies supporting this premise. As a consequence, this
                has been accepted as fact by popular opinion.</p>
            <p>I have read two books that support this thesis. Both books have
                received considerable notoriety and circulation. they are:</p>

                The Roswell Resource Center</b> </a>has considerable information and
                discussion of the incident as well as a discussion of the Ray Santilli
                Alien autopsy film with clips from the film. In 1995 I was interviewed
                by a Japanese Documentary Film Company about the Alien autopsy film.
                After viewing the film I told the interviewer that the scenes of the
                autopsy in no way resembled any military operating room suite with which
                I was familiar. As a member of the 8th Air Force Inspector General Team
                from 1953 to 1957 I inspected over a dozen U.S. Air Force medical
                facilities, including Roswell AFB and Carswell AFB, Ft. Worth, Texas and
                I saw no such facility. No one apparently is sure where the autopsy took
                place but I am reasonably sure it was NOT in an AF medical facility.</p>

                Roswell: The Whole Story</a>. </b></p>
            <p>Jeffrey has done considerable research and was responsible for the
                so-called International Roswell Initiative to uncover the alleged
                cover-up of the event with the implication that there was indeed a crash
                of an extraterrestrial craft. His further research, which included
                numerous interviews with former members of the 509th Bomb Group, has led
                him to conclude otherwise. He has prepared a comprehensive <a href="http://www.roswell.org/"><b>

                his mind.</p>

            <p>In 1947 I was a Captain, U.S. Army (Medical Administrative Corps)
                assigned to Squadron M (Base Hospital), 509th Bomb Group at Roswell Army
                Air Base. My primary duty was Medical Supply Officer for the Base
                Hospital. You would think that with all of the books that have been
                written, TV shows fictionalizing the incident, and the coverage the
                summer of 1997 in the media (major articles in the <u><b>New</b> <b>York
                    Times</b></u>, cover stories in <u><b>Time Magazine</b></u> and <u><b>
                    Popular Science</b></u>) that there must have been a great furor at the
                Base at that time (July 1947). To the contrary, life went on as usual.
                Most of the medical staff spent their time at the Officer's Club
                swimming pool every afternoon after duty hours. The biggest excitement
                was the cut-throat hearts game in the BOQ and an intense bingo, bango
                bungo golf game at the local nine hole golf course for a nickel a
                point!! There was absolutely <b>NO </b>unusual activity on the Base, no
                base alerts, no hysteria, no panic in July 1947. Life went on as usual. </p>

                Force football team)</em></p>
            <p>In fact, the first I heard of this "cataclysmic event" was in the Fall
                of 1992 when I was called by Stanton Friedman to see if I could verify
                any of the activities that allegedly occurred at the Base Hospital
                concerning the recovery of alien remains. Friedman had found my name and
                picture in the <b>1947 RAAF Yearbook. </b>My wife, Jane (who was with me
                in Roswell and who worked on the base), and I decided we had better try
                and find out what had supposedly happened. We did a library search and
                later obtained the Friedman/Berliner book and the Randle/Schmitt book
                cited above. What we have found is that much of what is in these books
                concerning the Base Hospital is incorrect and more fiction than fact.</p>
            <p>In<b> <u>Crash at Corona</u></b>, <a href="glenndennis.htm">Glenn
                Dennis</a>, a young mortician employed by the Ballard Funeral Home in
                Roswell, is reported as having brought an injured GI "to the base
                infirmary, which was in the same building as the hospital and mortuary."
                (p.116) Dennis is also quoted as saying he had received numerous calls
                from the Roswell AAF mortuary officer concerning sealed caskets . One of
                the photographs following p. 70 is captioned: "Rear of the hospital at
                Roswell Army Air Field. It was here that Glenn Dennis parked and walked
                in while small humanoid bodies were being prepared for shipment."
                Dennis, in his statements, tells of discussions with a young nurse,
                later identified as Naomi Maria Selff, who told him (Dennis) details
                about "three little bodies" being autopsied at the Base Hospital.</p>
            <b></b><p><b>FACTS: </b></p><ol>
                <li>There was no mortuary on the Base. There was no AAF mortuary officer
                    with such an assignment. As Medical Supply Officer I was responsible for
                    obtaining, maintaining and issuing all supplies and equipment for the
                    Base Hospital and any functions of a mortuary officer would have been
                    within my responsibilities. I never met Glenn Dennis and I don't recall
                    ever calling him for anything.</li>
                <li>There was no nurse named Naomi Maria Selff assigned to the Base
                    Hospital during the period I was assigned there (1946-1948). I was well
                    acquainted with all five nurses assigned during this time and none of
                    them anywhere near fit Dennis' description of the nurse he knew. Further
                    research by UFO researcher Victor Golubic has determined that no nurse
                    by that name was ever commissioned in the U.S. Army or assigned to the
                    Army Air Force.</li>
                <li>The photograph cited above is of a two story brick structure. The
                    entire hospital complex was a World War II cantonment type, one-story,
                    wooden frame structure. There were NO two story buildings and NO brick
                    structures in the complex.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In their book, <b><u>The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell</u>,</b>
                Randle and Schmitt state that a Major Jesse B. Johnson, Squadron M,
                509th Bomb Group, (Base Hospital), was the base pathologist, who
                assisted in a preliminary autopsies on alien bodies. In their footnotes
                to Chapter 10, Randle &amp; Schmitt claim that "Johnson's position as a
                pathologist has been verified by a number of former members of the 509th
                Bomb Group {and} verified by the 509th yearbook and the RAAF unit
                history."</p>
            <b></b><p align="left"><b>FACTS: </b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><p align="left">There was a physician named Jesse B. Johnson
                    assigned to the Base Hospital. However, he was a 1st Lt., not a Major,
                    and he was a radiologist, not a pathologist. He had no training as a
                    pathologist and would have been the last member of the medical staff to
                    have performed any autopsy on a human much less an alien!! He is
                    identified as a 1st Lt in the 509th Yearbook.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p align="left">After I learned of these assertions, I called Doctor
                    Jack Comstock, who, as a Major, was the Hospital Commander in 1947, and
                    in 1995 was living in retirement in Boulder, Colorado. I asked him if he
                    recalled any such events occurring in July of 1947 and he said
                    absolutely not. When I told him that Jesse B. was supposed to have
                    conducted a preliminary autopsy on alien bodies, he had a hard time
                    stopping laughing - his response was: PREPOSTEROUS!!</p>
                </li>
                <li>Major Comstock lived in the Hospital BOQ, located in the hospital
                    complex. Any unusual activity was immediately reported to him by members
                    of the medical and nursing staff. He told me (this was in 1995 prior to
                    his death in February 1996) that NOTHING of this nature occurred in July
                    1947 at the Base Hospital.</li>
            </ol>
            <b></b><p><b>CONCLUSIONS AND OBSERVATIONS:</b></p>
            <p>From first-hand knowledge, I am reasonably certain that no alien bodies
                were brought to the Base Hospital in July 1947 where "preliminary
                autopsies" were supposedly conducted. There was no nurse by the name of
                Naomi Maria Selff ever assigned to Squadron M, 509th Bomb Group. The
                statements made by Glenn Dennis are not credible. The accounts in the
                Randle/Schmitt book concerning Jesse B. Johnson are fiction.</p>
            <b></b><p align="left"><b>8TH AIR FORCE FOOTBALL TEAM</b></p>
            <p>One of my problems with all of the literature I have read on the
                subject is that none of the researchers, with perhaps the exception of
                Kent Jeffrey in his <u><b>Anatomy of a Myth</b></u>, have paid any
                attention to the activities at Roswell Army Air Field during the summer
                and fall of 1947, apparently on the assumption we were all involved with
                the "crash."</p>
            <p>In fact, during the late summer and fall of 1947, in addition to
                routine training, Roswell AAF became the home of an 8th Air Force
                football team. Lt. Al Nemetz, an All-American, who played tackle on the
                1945-46 Army National Championship team at West Point, was assigned to
                the 509th Bomb Group. Colonel Blanchard asked him if he would coach an
                8th AF football team if he could get General Roger Ramey's approval to
                form such a team. Briefly, Al said "yes," General Ramey approved and a
                team was organized. Players were recruited from all 8th AF units and
                those with high school or college football experience were sent to RAAF
                on temporary duty. (Players included Lts Bobby Dobbs and Max Minor who
                also played on the West Point National Championship team) The team
                practiced most of the summer and games were scheduled. Games were played
                against teams from Ft. Bliss, Randolph AAF, played at TCU's Farrington
                Field in Fort Worth, Texas (the Randolph team included All-Americans Doc
                Blanchard and Arnold Tucker from the National Champions), games in
                Tucson, Denver(Lowry AAF), and Los Alamos. We even flew at team in from
                Carrol College, Minnesota for a game in Roswell. Games in Roswell were
                played on the local high school field. The team included officers and
                enlisted men from various bases and units. Roswell, New Mexico was then
                a small community and rather isolated and Colonel Blanchard did this as
                morale effort.</p>
            <p>It is inconceivable that such an undertaking would have taken place if
                there was the remote possibilty that a "cataclytic event" had occurred
                which could have been perceived as a threat to national security.</p>
            <p>I know all of this first hand as Colonel Blanchard asked me to be the
                "Business Manager" for the team, in addition to my other duties at the
                Base Hospital. As such, I scheduled all games, arranged for the housing,
                feeding and equipment for the team, and scheduled all travel
                arrangements. There is a picture of the entire team in the 1947 RAAF
                Yearbook. Here is a shot of Lt Al Nemetz and others on the sideline
                during a game in Roswell, New Mexico.</p>
            <p>[Picture not included here]</p>
            <p>I got to know General Blanchard very well as an officer under his
                command at Roswell AAF and with the 7th Air Division. He was, as his
                record surely reflects, an outstanding officer, who was highly
                respected. According to Lt. Haut's testimony about the event, Colonel
                Blanchard ordered him to issue a press release announcing that a "flying
                disk" have been recovered. While I am sure this is how Lt. Haut
                remembers it, I would argue that this not the action that a responsible
                commander would have taken given the importance of such a discovery. He
                would have <b>first </b>reported the fact to his commander, General
                Ramey, at Hq, 8th Air Force. Also, if Colonel Blanchard had believed
                that this "finding" was of such magnitude it is highly unlikely that he
                would have delegated the responsibility of transporting the debris to
                others. He would probably done so himself. And he surely would have
                avoided any publicity until he knew what he was dealing with.</p>
            <p>Those of us who served in the 509th Bomb Group at the time had
                considerable pride in our unit and respected our commanders. I believe
                we would have acted responsibly and promptly if there had been such a
                "cataclysmic event." The accusations that any of us have been involved
                in some sort of massive cover-up is ludicrous for one simple reason: <b>
                    Nothing occurred to cover up!</b></p></td>
